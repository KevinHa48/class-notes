## **CS-546 Notes**
---

## **October 25th**

Topics covered:
- Basic HTML
- Git + GitHub Basics

Git good practices:
- Use a Dev branch when developing. Main should be only good code that is working and ready for production
- Use pull requests to merge changes from different branches


Git basic commands:
```
The classic formula:
git add * / git add .
git commit -m "your_message_goes_here"
git push

Changing branches:
git checkout my_branch

Add -b to the command above to create a new branch with that name!

```

HTML Good Cood Practices:
- Download HTML5 Boilerplate if using VSCode.
- **You will be docked points for using `<b>, <center>` etc..**
- `alt` attributes are for disability purposes. When screenreaders read the alt tag they will most likely say "Image of `alt`", so avoid using name like "Image of X" as it is redundant.
- **Use an HTML validation tool before submitting assignments! Check lab7 for the link.**
